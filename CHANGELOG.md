  - Example 1:
  ```jsonc
  {
    "sort-json.settings.orderOverrideKeys": {
      "package.json": ["name", "version"], // order override keys specific to package.json file
      "": ["id", "title"] // order override keys for all files
    }
  }
  ```
  - Example 2:
  ```jsonc
  {
    "sort-json.settings.orderOverrideKeys": ["id", "title"] // order override keys for all files
  }
  ```

  - For example: unicode string: `\u21D3` will not be converted to (`â†§`) character on sorting.
  - This is unstable and may not fully compatible with all unicode's. Please use this with caution.

## v14.0.0

- Support for Sort JSON with comments.
- Support for Sort JSON with ES6 standards ( allows single quotes and keys with no quotes ).
- Added - `...` spread operator to spread remaining keys in middle of overridden keys.
